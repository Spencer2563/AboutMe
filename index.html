            <p style="text-indent: 30pt" id="Paragraph1">I have spent my early childhood fantasizing about the idea of creating something truly unique and long-lasting. That’s why I am  pursuing a career as a Game Developer Working independently or with a small team. I believe many of the best games today are produced by independent developers and studios who are not under the constant pressure of Business Higher ups. Small teams also allow for great cooperation and shared vision in regards to a final product.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 30pt" id="Paragraph2"> I am a great communicator and love interacting with a team. I enjoyed my time in Drama where I gained a new understanding of cooperation and building off of one another. From a technical standpoint I possess skills in C++ and Unreal Engine; I will continue to expand my knowledge on these subjects as my development career continues. I am also in the early stages of learning blender and plan to take Video Game Art and Design in my next or following year of high school. This class will revolve mostly around 3d Modeling in Maya Autodesk and core concepts of video game design. I have participated in a few game jams but at the moment finding time is a struggle.
